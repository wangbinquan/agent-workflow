// `sealed_at` NULL, NOT dispatched, an answered-unconsumed round whose rerun is pending). So a home

// continuation node_run BEFORE any board read reconciles the task_question — so a task_questions-based

// (double-mint). Distinguishing a quick-channel continuation (OPEN — has a pending continuation run)
// from a control-channel sealed-but-parked round (NOT open — no continuation minted) is done by the
